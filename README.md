Parts of code from: Quantum Machine Learning with Python: Using Cirq from Google Research and IBM Qiskit by Santanu Pattanayak.

A multithread web crawler will be controlled by the result of measuring how many 0 or 1 were there after running (submitting a job) in a quantum simulator.

This code uses Qiskit.

Tested to work on Python 3.10 under M1 Macbook Air - MacOS Ventura 13
